%% Spike train classification

% Single unit criteria
% general criteria
    % L-ratio ?0.1
    % average peak amplitude ?80 ?V
% % specific criteria
    % less than 40% of total recording time in ISIs smaller than 2 s
    % a post-spike suppression period of [less than 0.1 ms]
    % a waveform peak width smaller than [0.15 ms]
    % a waveform valley width smaller than [0.35 ms]
    % a firing rate above 2 Hz 

 % plot average waveforms by peak width, valley width, and firing rate (on log scale).
